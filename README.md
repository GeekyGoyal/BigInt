# BigInt
The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci etc.

## Objective
Add support for Big Integers (numbers greater than 18446744073709551615) in C along with basic mathematical operations and functions.

## Applications
- Calculate factorial of very large integers
- Calculate very large nth Fibonacci number
- Calculate binomial coefficient of very large numbers
- Perform binary exponentiation on very large numbers or raise numbers to very large powers
- Greatest Common Divisor
