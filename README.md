# BigInt
The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci etc.

## Objective
Add support for Big Integers (numbers greater than 18446744073709551615) in C along with basic mathematical operations and functions.

## Applications
- Calculate factorial of very large integers.
- Calculate very large nth Fibonacci number.
- Calculate binomial coefficient of very large numbers.
- Greatest Common Divisor.
- Perform binary exponentiation on very large numbers or raise numbers to very large powers.

## Requirements
- You may assume all BigInts are at most 1000 digits long, hence using malloc function, declare a 1001 element character array. The 1 extra element will be for the null character '\0'.
- To avoid computing with garbage values, initialize all elements of the declared BigInt to 0.

## Why we need BigInt?
While practicing Competitive Programming or in most of the programming contests, you might have noticed that you are required to print the result in 10^9+7 modulo. </br>
:thinking: Ever wondered WHY?  </br>
Because of **Integer Overflows.**  The largest integer datatype in C/C++ is _long long int_ and it can store integers from 2^(-63) to 2^(63). (that is ~ 10^18). But, you might come across some cases where this range of _unsigned long long int_ will be insufficient to handle such big numbers. So, instead of printing the exact value, we are required to print the answer modulo some number M. <br>
Criteria on which the value of M depends: </br>
1. It should be large enough to fit in an int data type. (~10^9) </br>
2. It should be a prime number. </br>

10^9+7 fulfills both the criteria. </br>
**NOTE:** In programming, due to the size of variable limitations, we perform modulo M at each intermediate stage so that range overflow never occurs. </br>
There are few Distributive properties of Modulo, which you can learn while doing **Modular Arithematic** </br>

Attaching the links of a few problems available online to practice arithematic operations on big integers: </br>

## Motivation Behind this Project
- GANGNAM STYLE: </br>
    YouTube developers built their platform with a counter using a signed 32-bit integer. </br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 2^(31) - 1 = 2147483647 </br>
    This means the maximum possible views could 2,147,483,647. (~ 2.1 billion). </br>

    Gangnam Style breached the barrier, showing more than 2.1 billion views & we got some arbitrary result.

    To solve this, YouTube upgraded to 64-bit integer for its video counter, which means videos have a maximum viewer count of 9,223,372,036,854,776,000. (~ 9.22 quintillion). </br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 2^(63) - 1 = 9223372036854776000

- UNIX EPOCH TIME: <br>
    Unix systems record time values as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970. 32-bit systems use a signed 32-bit integer for this, so they will wrap around 2,147,483,647 seconds after that date. Two billion seconds is about 68 years; on January 19, 2038, at 03:14:07 in the morning, 32-bit Unix clocks will roll over. One second past that is a time counter overflow, which results in the time flying 137 years into the past, because the time counter becomes -2,147,483,648. Unix machines are eventually going to run out of the bits to tick off seconds. So, on that day, the C programs that use the standard time library will start to have problems with dates.</br> 
    This Year 2038 Problem is also called Unix Millenium Bug or Y2K38 bug.

    Hereâ€™s an animation showing how the Year 2038 bug would reset the date:
